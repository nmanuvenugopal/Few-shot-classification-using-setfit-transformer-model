SetFit (Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning) is an effective framework designed for the few-shot fine-tuning of Sentence Transformers (note: When referring to a "Siamese approach" in the context of Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning, it typically means using a Siamese neural network architecture. In a Siamese network, two identical subnetworks are created, often referred to as twin networks or Siamese twins). The training process is structured into two stages:

Sentence Transformer Fine-Tuning:
This stage employs a Siamese approach on sentence pairs. The objective is to maximize the distance between semantically different sentences while minimizing the distance between semantically similar sentences.

Classification Head Training:
In this stage, the enriched text embeddings, along with the corresponding class labels, constitute the training set for classification. A logistic regression model is utilized as the classification model, with the potential for future expansion to include other classification models.

Why SetFit ?

SetFit demonstrates a remarkable ability to achieve high accuracy even when trained on limited labeled data, making it effective in scenarios with insufficient training examples.

One notable feature of SetFit is its prompt-free classification. In contrast to some existing few-shot classification techniques that rely on manually crafted prompts to guide the model, SetFit operates without the need for such prompts.

The efficiency of SetFit is evident in its quick and straightforward training process. Unlike traditional transformer models, SetFit does not demand extensive amounts of data for effective training.

An additional advantage of SetFit lies in its versatility. The SetFit classifier seamlessly integrates with any transformer model available on the Hugging Face Hub. This adaptability allows for text classification across various languages, extending the applicability of the model to multilingual contexts.

How does it work?

SetFit follows a two-step training process. Initially, it fine-tunes a Sentence Transformer model using a limited set of labeled examples, typically around 8 or 16 per class. Subsequently, a classifier head is trained on the embeddings produced by the fine-tuned Sentence Transformer. This approach leverages a small labeled dataset to enhance the performance of the Sentence Transformer and then utilizes the enriched embeddings for further training a classifier, contributing to effective few-shot learning.
