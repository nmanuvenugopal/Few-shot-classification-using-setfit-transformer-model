# Few-shot-classification-using-setfit-transformer-model

Zero-shot classification involves inputting data into a pre-trained model, allowing the model to categorize text, sentences, or images based on its acquired knowledge during training, wherein it has been exposed to substantial data. On the other hand, few-shot classification involves supplying some training data to the model pertaining to the dataset and then instructing the model to categorize subsequent data.

## Advantages of the Setfit model over OpenAI models:
Prompt-free functionality: Unlike OpenAI models that necessitate a prompt, Setfit operates without one, reducing variability in results based on query quality.
Quicker training: Setfit's training process is faster as it does not require heavyweight models.
Multilingual capabilities: Setfit supports multiple languages.
